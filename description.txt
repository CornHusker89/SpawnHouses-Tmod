When making a world, a house will spawn near the spawn point, and another will spawn on a beach.

You can use Mod Configs to enable/disable generation of any house.

If you come across any bugged world generation, be sure to leave a comment with the world seed on the mod's steam page, along with any other useful information such as other world generation mods or location of the bugged generation.

Expect much, much more in the coming weeks! We've got a lot of new things coming up
