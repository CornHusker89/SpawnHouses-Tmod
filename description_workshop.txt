When making a world, a house with a few chests will spawn at the spawn point, and another will spawn on a beach.

This mod has Magic Storage integration! A starter setup will spawn with the main house (can be turned off in configs).

Use Mod Configs to enable/disable generation of any house.

If you liked the mod, please give a mod a rating! If you didn't like it, that's cool too! If you're willing to, a comment about why you didn't like it would be appreciated!

If you come across any bugged world generation, be sure to leave a comment with the world seed and your configs on the mod's steam page, along with any other useful information such as other world generation mods or location of the bugged generation.

Huge thanks to ScalarVector1's Structure Helper, this wouldn't be possible without it! Workshop page can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790924965] Here [/url]

Expect much, much more in the coming weeks! We've got a lot of new things coming up.
