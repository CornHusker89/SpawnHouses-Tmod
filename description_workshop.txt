When making a world, a house with a few chests and a procedural basement will spawn at the spawn point, and another will spawn on a beach.

This mod has Magic Storage integration! A starting setup will spawn with the main house (can be turned off in configs).

Use Mod Configs to enable/disable generation of any house.

- Current Compatibilities - 
- Calamity
- Spirit
- Remnants
- Start with base (only if spawn point house/basement is disabled in this mod)

Anything else not listed just means I haven't tested whether it's compatible. Any mod that changes anything in the spawn point or beaches has the potential to break the mods.

If you liked the mod, please give a mod a rating! If you didn't like it, that's cool too! If you're willing to, a comment about why you didn't like it would be appreciated!
